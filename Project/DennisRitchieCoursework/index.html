              <h2>Who was Dennis Ritchie?</h2>
              <p>Dennis Ritchie was a pioneering American computer scientist whose work fundamentally shaped modern computing. 
                He is best known as the creator of the C programming language and the co-creator of the UNIX operating system, 
                two technologies that underpin much of today’s software infrastructure. His contributions have had a lasting 
                impact on programming, operating systems, and the way computers are built and used around the world.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
              <p>
                Ritchie was born in 1941 in New York. He studied physics and applied mathematics at Harvard University, where he 
                initially planned to pursue scientific research. During his time at Harvard, he became increasingly interested in 
                computing after encountering early computer systems and programming tools. This exposure sparked a fascination with 
                how software could be used to solve complex problems, ultimately leading him towards a career in computer science.
              </p>
              
              <h2>Career at Bell Labs</h2>
              <p>
                Ritchie joined Bell Labs in the late 1960s, a time when the institution was known as a powerhouse of technological 
                innovation. At Bell Labs, he worked closely with Ken Thompson on operating systems research, a collaboration that 
                would lead to the development of UNIX. The environment at Bell Labs encouraged creativity, experimentation, and 
                open research, making it an ideal setting for the breakthroughs that Ritchie and his colleagues would go on to 
                achieve.
