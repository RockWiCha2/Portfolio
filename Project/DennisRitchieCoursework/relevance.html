                <h2>The Continuing Influence of C</h2>
                <p>
                    The C programming language continues to play a central role in modern computing. Many major operating systems, 
                    including Linux, parts of Windows, and the kernels of macOS, are written largely in C because of its 
                    efficiency, reliability and close control over hardware. C is also essential in embedded systems, 
                    where microcontrollers, automotive software, and countless IoT devices rely on its speed and low-level 
                    capabilities. Beyond this, C has shaped the design of many modern programming languages; C++, C#, Java, 
                    Rust and Go all inherit ideas, syntax or core principles from C. This ongoing influence matters to 
                    everyday users because it underpins the stability and performance of the systems we interact with 
                    daily, from smartphones and laptops to cars, routers and home appliances.
                </p>

                <h2>UNIX in Modern Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    The design principles behind UNIX continue to define today’s operating systems. Both macOS and iOS are 
                    directly UNIX-based, inheriting its structure and philosophy. Linux, which powers most of the world’s 
                    web servers and cloud infrastructure, is UNIX-like in design and behaviour. Even Android, the world’s 
                    most widely used mobile OS, runs on top of a Linux kernel. Core command-line tools still follow the UNIX 
                    philosophy of small, modular utilities that work together through simple interfaces. These ideas, first 
                    developed by Ritchie and Thompson, remain central to how modern systems operate.
                </p>

                <h2>Impact on the Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    A large portion of the global internet runs on infrastructure built around UNIX-like systems. Most web 
                    servers rely on Linux, whose foundations trace back to UNIX and therefore to Ritchie's work. Many early 
                    networking tools and protocols were developed on UNIX systems because they were stable, flexible and widely 
                    available in research environments. As a result, much of the internet’s architecture still depends on 
                    concepts pioneered by UNIX, making Ritchie’s contributions deeply embedded in the way online communication 
                    functions today.
                </p>

                <h2>Influence on Software Development Culture</h2>
                <p>
                    UNIX introduced a culture of simple, powerful tools that can be combined to perform complex tasks. 
                    Concepts such as shells, pipelines and the idea of “small programmes working together” continue to 
                    shape modern development workflows. Developers today still rely heavily on command-line environments 
                    that follow UNIX traditions. Even Git the most widely used version control system was created by 
                    Linus Torvalds for UNIX-like systems and fits naturally into this philosophy. These ideas have shaped 
                    how software is built, tested and deployed across the industry.</p>

                <h2>The Legacy of Dennis Ritchie</h2>
                <p>
                    Dennis Ritchie’s work forms the backbone of modern computing. Many of the technologies people use every day
                     smartphones, laptops, servers and embedded devices rely directly on UNIX or the C programming language.
                     While his name is not as publicly recognised as figures like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, Ritchie’s influence
                     is arguably far deeper, shaping the foundations of both software and hardware design. His contributions 
                     enabled generations of developers to build the digital world we live in today, making him one of the most
                     significant yet understated pioneers in computing history.
