                <h2>The Development of the C Programming Language</h2>
                <p>
                    The C programming language was developed to provide programmers with a more portable and expressive alternative 
                    to assembly language. Its goal was to allow low-level, efficient programming while still enabling code to be 
                    moved between different computer systems with minimal modification. C achieved this by offering structured 
                    programming features, powerful pointer manipulation, and precise memory control, all of which allowed 
                    developers to write fast and reliable software. One of its greatest strengths was its ability to produce 
                    code that could be reused on different machines, which made it a highly practical and forward-thinking 
                    language for its time.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Why C Became So Influential</h2>
                <p>
                    C’s influence grew rapidly after the UNIX operating system was rewritten in it, transforming UNIX from a system 
                    tied to a specific machine into one that could run on many different types of hardware. This portability helped 
                    UNIX spread widely in universities, research labs and industry, which in turn popularised C itself. Over time, 
                    C became the foundation for numerous later programming languages, including C++, C#, Java and Objective-C, 
                    many of which inherited C’s syntax, structure and core concepts.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Creation of the UNIX Operating System</h2>
                <p>
                    UNIX was originally built by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson on a PDP-7 computer, with the aim of creating a 
                    simple, efficient and multi-user operating system. Its design philosophy introduced several ideas that were 
                    revolutionary at the time. UNIX treated “everything as a file”, providing a clean and consistent way to interact 
                    with devices and data. It encouraged the use of small, modular programs that worked together to perform 
                    complex tasks. Features such as pipes and redirection allowed users to combine commands in powerful ways, 
                    while multi-user capability made the system suitable for shared computing environments. These principles 
                    became the foundation of modern operating system design.
                </p>
            
                <h2>Collaboration with Ken Thompson</h2>
                <p>
                    Ritchie’s long-term collaboration with Ken Thompson shaped many of the core ideas that underpin modern computing. 
                    Their teamwork combined Thompson’s operating-system expertise with Ritchie’s language and systems design skills, 
                    resulting in innovations such as the C language and the evolution of UNIX. Their joint achievements were 
                    recognised globally, most notably when they received the Turing Award in 1983 for their contributions to 
                    computer science.
                </p>

                <h2>Why These Contributions Were Groundbreaking</h2>
                <p>The work of Ritchie and his collaborators fundamentally changed the direction of computing. UNIX demonstrated that an operating system could be both simple and powerful, while remaining portable across different machines. C enabled programmers to write efficient, low-level software without being tied to a particular hardware platform. Together, these innovations laid the foundations for countless technologies used today, influencing programming languages, operating systems and software engineering practices worldwide.</p>
